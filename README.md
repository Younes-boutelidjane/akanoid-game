# Arkanoid Game using SFML

This repository contains an Arkanoid game implemented using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game is developed as part of our IT class project.

## Game Description

Arkanoid is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and tries to break all the bricks at the top using a bouncing ball. The player must prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen by moving the paddle left and right. Each time a brick is hit, it gets destroyed, and the player earns points. The goal is to clear all the bricks on the screen and achieve the highest score possible.

## Technologies Used

- C++: The game is implemented in C++ programming language.
- SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is used for graphics, audio, and input handling.
- Docker: Docker is used for containerization.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with paddle and bouncing ball.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Power-ups and bonuses to enhance gameplay.
- High score tracking and display.
- Sound effects and background music.
